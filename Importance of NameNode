NameNode: 
A NameNode contains two important information. They are:
                                                1) Hadoop File System Tree and Metadata
                                                2) In-memory mapping of blocks and corresponding data node.
 
The NameNode is the center-piece of an HDFS file system. It keeps the directory tree of all files 
in the file system, and tracks where across the cluster the file data is kept. It does not the data of these files itself.

Client applications talkk to the Name Node whenever they wish to locate a file or when they want to add or copy or move or delete a file.

The NameNode is a Single Point of failure for the HDFS cluster. HDFS is not currently a High Availablity system. When the NameNode goes 
down, the file system goes offline. There is an optional Secondary NameNode that can be hosted on a seperate machine. It only creates checkpoints
of the namespace by merging the edits file into the fsimage file and does not provide any real redundancy. Hadop has a BackupNameNode that is part of a plan
to have a name service. 

Name Node is the Master node of the HDFS file system in Hadoop.
- It stores metadata and informations of its slave nodes.
- Namenode also maintains the informatin of all addresses of the files or blocks in the file system.
- Namenode don't store the data of all of its slave nodes.
- NameNode knows how to construct the file from blocks kept in different cluster.s.

HIGH Availability ensures when the active namenode goes down, Secondary namenode  necomes Active.
